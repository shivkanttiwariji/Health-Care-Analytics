Project Title: Health Care Analytics
Objective:
To analyze patient health data to identify key health risk factors and trends, and to provide actionable insights for improving patient care and health outcomes.

Dataset:
The dataset includes various health metrics such as:

Total patient count
Gender distribution
Health risk habits (e.g., smoking)
Heart attack and stroke risks
Age group distribution

Insights:
Gender Distribution: Analyze the proportion of male and female patients and their respective health risks.
Health Risk Habits: Identify the percentage of patients with habits like smoking and their correlation with health risks.
Heart Attack and Stroke Risks: Determine the percentage of patients at risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Age Group Analysis: Examine health risks across different age groups.
Overweight Analysis: Assess the distribution of overweight patients by gender and race.

Steps to Follow:
Data Cleaning: Ensure the dataset is free from inconsistencies, typos, and missing values.
Data Segmentation: Break down the data into meaningful segments (e.g., by gender, age group).
Data Visualization: Use charts and graphs to visualize the data and identify patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests to validate the insights.
Report Generation: Compile the findings into a comprehensive report with actionable recommendations.

Aim:
To leverage data analytics to improve patient care by identifying key health risk factors and trends, thereby enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions and implement effective interventions.
